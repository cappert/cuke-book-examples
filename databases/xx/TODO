Puzzled.

It seems like we have a couple of problems:

1) the distributed architecture prevents us from being able to demonstrate transactions at all.
  - oh no wait, we could have a step that calls BalanceStore directly to set the balance, keeping it all in the same transactoin

2) bigger problem, sqlite3 seems to get confused about locks
